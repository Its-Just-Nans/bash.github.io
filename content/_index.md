I'm studying mathematics at the [University of Zurich][UZH].
In my spare time I enjoy coding on one of my many side projects. I love playing
video games, especially puzzle and story
driven ones.

Every month or so I organize a [game night]
for my friends and acquaintances from uni.

Visit my [GitHub profile] if you're interested
in what I'm currently working on.

I very infrequently post things on [Mastodon].

## Contact

I love getting emailâ€”from non-spammers that is ^^ \
