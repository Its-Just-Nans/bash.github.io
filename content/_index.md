I'm passionate about programming, plants and solving puzzles.

In my spare time I enjoy coding on one of my many side projects. I love playing
video games, especially puzzle and story driven ones.

Every month or so I organize a fun and cozy [game night] for my friends.

Visit my [GitHub profile] if you're interested
in what I'm currently working on.

I very infrequently post things on [Mastodon].

## Contact

I love getting emailâ€”from non-spammers that is ^^ \
Send your messages to <span id="email" class="_targetable">`public-inbox (at) tau.garden`</span>.

Instead of opening a pull request on GitHub,
you may also send patches to `patches (at) tau.garden`.

Not sure how to talk about me (i.e. what pronouns to use)? I put together a [helpful page](/pronouns).
