title = "Launching Sublime Merge via CLI"
+++

[Sublime Merge] can be launched using the `smerge` command
similar to the `subl` command for [Sublime Text].

Apart from the primary use case of opening a path by using `smerge <path>`
you can also open other tools such as blame (`smerge blame`) or log (`smerge log`).
