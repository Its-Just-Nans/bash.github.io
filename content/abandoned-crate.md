I currently don't have any abandoned crates up for grabs. \
You must have stumbled across a dead link.

For posterity, here's what this page used to say:
> Hi there ğŸ‘‹
>
> You have stumbled across one of my abandoned crates on [crates.io](https://crates.io/users/bash).
>
> If you want it, send me an email to abandoned-crate (at) tau.garden. This email should include the crate name and your crates.io username (I need the username to transfer the crate to you).
>
> Tau~
