Thank you for asking, I appreciate it! ☺️

The easiest way to refer to me is by my first name *Tau*
or by using gender neutral pronouns such as *they/them* or *it*.

In a formal setting, *they/them* works best. For example: \
«*Tau* put a lot of work into this—*they* must be really proud of the result.»

In a more informal setting, *they/them* or *it* both work equally well: \
«Don't mind the weird noises—*it* hasn't had *its* morning coffee yet.»

Please don't use group expressions such as *guys* or *men*
when referring to a group that I'm a part of. There are many awesome
alternatives available such as *team*, *folks*, *peeps*, *comrades*, and many more.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to [ask](/#email).
