I have always assumed that $0^0$ is undefined with the same «severity» as $0 \div 0$,
but in a lot of [contexts][0_pow_0], it is actually defined as $0^0 = 1$. \
Most notably to me in this category are the IEEE floating-point numbers [^1].

[^1]: There is technically the `powr` function, which treats $0^0$ as `NaN`, but most programming languages use the `pow` function.
