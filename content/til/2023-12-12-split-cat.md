title = "Chunking A Large File"
+++

Today I had the misfortune of having to transfer a file larger than 4 GiB using a FAT32-formatted USB drive.

Luckily there's the handy [`split`] command that splits a file into multiple chunks.

The following command splits the file into chunks that are each at most 4 GiB large:
```sh
split --bytes 4G large_file
```
The chunks are named `xaa`, `xab`, `xac`, …

On the other side one can use [`cat`] to reconstruct the file from its chunks:
```sh
cat x* > large_file
```
